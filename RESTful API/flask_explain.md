What Is Flask?

Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework written in Python. It allows you to build web applications quickly without a lot of setup or configuration.
It is considered a microframework because it doesn’t include extra tools like authentication or database support by default.
You can add extensions when you need them.
Very good for RESTful APIs and simple web servers.
