# STRINGS
# Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
# 'hello' is the same as "hello".
# You can display a string literal with the print() function:

print('Hello')
print("Hello")

# Quotes Inside Quotes
# You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:

print("It's alright")
print("He is called 'Cavin'")
print('He is called "Cavin"')

# Assign String to a Variable
# Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:

a = "Hello"
print(a)
